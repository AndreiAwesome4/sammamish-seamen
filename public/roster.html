              <p class="lead"> Jonah Park was hired by the Seamen on a record breaking contract, and there's a good reason for that. With experience in top notch programs with Assistant Bulankou at Duke and Gonzaga, Park is someone the players admire and wish to impress. His eating habits hopefully will not carry on to the players as his raging obssession with McDonalds is getting out of hand. </p>

              <p class="lead"> Adam Labbe, the social media fanatic has developed the seamen's online influence that stretches all over the world. His camera skills and caption ideas demonstrate his pure talent. His dressing style is a concern, as multiple reports of a man wearing a "suit" with "spongebob socks" has been reported around the area which obviously has a negative look on the Seamen.</p>
